# Code for paper "Distributed Real-time Soil Saturation Assessment in Levees Using a Network of Wireless Sensor"
This work is published and presented in IMECHE 2024. The full title of this paper is "Distributed Real-time Soil Saturation Assessment in Levees Using a Network of Wireless Sensor Packages With Conductivity Probes". This folder contains code, data, and plots for 1D kriging for compacted soil  for paper IMECHE 2024 related to Data-driven fragility framework: Developed a framework for risk assessment of levee breaches Project (funded by the NSF grant number 2152896)

* **data**: This folder has raw data named "combined_data_original.csv". Here are also post-processed data for analysis:
  * `combined_data_all_time_5spikes.csv`
  

* **plots**: This folder saves all plots after running the code.

* **plot_2D_5spike_data.py**: This code is used for 2D plotting during voltage vs Time (also to show specific time stamps (TS)).

* **kriging_1D_wlc_boolean_operator**: This is 1D kriging code for compacted sand soil composition.
